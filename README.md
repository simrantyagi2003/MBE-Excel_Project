# MBE-Excel_Project
*I successfully developed a Material Balance Model for predicting Original Oil in Place (OOIP), utilizing industry-standard tools such as MBAL. This project demonstrated my proficiency in reservoir engineering and simulation, employing various MBAL tools, including Material Balance, Reservoir Allocation, and Monte Carlo volumetric analysis. By configuring production predictions and constraints, I generated insightful visualizations of reservoir parameters, showcasing my ability to address real-world challenges in the oil and gas industry. This experience solidifies my technical expertise and positions me as a candidate well-equipped for an internship role, where I can contribute to optimizing reservoir management strategies.*
